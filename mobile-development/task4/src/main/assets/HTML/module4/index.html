<h1>Module D—Front-end</h1>
<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
    A new founded company is looking for full stack developers to create an online browser gaming platform. Game developers can upload their games to the platform and users can play them online in the browser.
</p>
<p>
    There are three parts to the platform:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Game Developer Portal: A web application for game developers to upload their games to the platform.
    </li>
    <li>
        Administrator Portal: A web application for administrators to manage the platform with its users and games.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gaming Portal: A web application for players to play games online in the browser.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The company wants to create a minimum viable product (MVP) for the platform. The MVP should already contain the aforementioned parts, but it is acceptable that the Game Developer Portal and the Administrator Portal are not fleshed out yet. The Gaming Portal should be fully functional, so that users can play games online in the browser.
</p>
<p>
    The project is split into two phases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        phase one (morning) for building the API and static pages using a PHP framework and MySQL database
    </li>
    <li>
        phase two (afternoon) for building the frontend parts using HTML/CSS and a JavaScript framework, consuming the API developed in phase one
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You are now in <b>Phase Two</b>. A backend implementation is provided so you can now focus on the frontend.
</p>
<p>
    You are <b>required</b> to use the provided version and not use your own backend solution from phase one. The provided API should be placed at /module_c_solution/
